# Project_Python_Pig_Game_04_03_2024
## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a simple implementation of the Pig Game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The Pig Game, also known as Pass the Pigs, is a classic dice game where players take turns rolling dice to score points. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a predefined score threshold.

## Features
- Graphical user interface implemented using Pygame for an interactive gaming experience.
- Players can roll a virtual dice to score points and advance their position in the game.
- Player scores are displayed on the screen along with the current player's turn.
- The game dynamically updates to reflect changes in player scores and the current game state.
- Visual cues and animations enhance the gameplay experience.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Players take turns rolling the dice by clicking on the screen.
3. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they lose all points accumulated in that turn.
4. Otherwise, the rolled number is added to the player's score.
5. The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `pig_game.py` script to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
